# Keystone Presentations

Like traditional tech events, we know it's important to bring leading perspectives in the
 industry for everyone to benefit from.

'Keystone' refers to one or more central stones at the summit of an arch, locking the whole together. We believe that there are individuals who've continuously make material contributions to the observability and OpenTelemetry communities who deserve voice at our table for many reasons. These individuals foster and shape the nature of observability despite the term's popularity in the past few years. They continue to help us all improve and contribute to a better sense of how our systems should emit intel and help us answer questions, on-call and otherwise.

# Community Group/Team Presentations

Unlike traditional events, we believe that ***you*** are the shining star of our conference. Instead of simply attending another online conference, your work over the past few years represents the very best of our industry. As such, you and your team should be highlighted as part of our community.

If you have meaningfully improved the observability at your organization and/or if you've contributed to the OpenTelemetry project or other tangential open source communities, ***[DO NOT HESITATE TO SUBMIT YOUR STORY to our rolling CFP process](/cfp)***.

# Community (p)reactions

A "PRE-action" video is a short 5min summary of what you think is ***meaningful***
 for others to pay attention to about another video or presentation by someone else.

Not only is this a great way to spread positivity about someone else, it also
 encodes how you process and what you value about the time and effort another
 practitioner has shared with the community.

# Sponsored Presentations

As a commercial organization in 2022, you face an uphill battle in the 'observability' community, not just in terms of market share, but in terms of vendor bullshit. There's alway a lot of that, no matter what train you want to catch. If you are a vendor, to submit a CFP to o11yfest 2022, consider the following:

1. Our community cares deeply about material and actionable improvements they can learn from your engineering teams
2. While you might feel you have something honest to share with our community, it should be in the form of an observability journey/story shared by a customer, ***NOT*** a product pitch or even that laced with evangelism/advocacy overtures
3. There is an extreme amount of antibodies in our content selection process related to sales pitches

If you think you can weather through these guidelines, feel free to refer [this CFP](/cfp) to your most qualified and community-reputable individual.

# Non-presentation Sponsorship Alternatives

We have spent many years thinking and considering how sponsorship is meaningful to our community. There are many alternatives to 'speaking time'. Please take time considering the impact of [our multiple sponsorship options](/sponsor), and if you have questions always feel free to [reach out to our organizers](/contact).
