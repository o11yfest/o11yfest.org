# Why Donate for Charity?

As a single contributor, you can make a difference, and we all should. As a group,
 we can make a significant collective difference for some really good causes:

# Logistics

This event will be held online on {{ site.current_event_dates }} and will be live captioned to respect accessibility for all attendees. It will also be accessible via mobile device and standard desktop browsers (the after-party platform is only for full browsers). Further logistics about day-of access will be provided the Friday before the event via email (so don't use a fake email for registration).

<h1>Who will be there?</h1>
<p>
Hundreds of other community members and engineering folks will be online listening to,
 discussing with, and learning from each other about observability practices.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and did we mention an ***amazing*** lineup of speakers, OpenTelemetry contributors,
 and practitioners already implementing advanced observability practices in their
 organizations?
</p>

So far, we've received presentations from the following speakers for 2022:
