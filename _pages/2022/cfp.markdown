# Our CFP is 'Rolling'

Because our conference isn't a monolith or oligarchy, we encourage everyone who has something that complies with the following criteria to submit:

- Your submission should serve others, not yourself
- Your submission should include others, not just yourself
- Your submission should not include product pitches

We will be accepting CFPs from now until the event in May, since being online/virtual means that there are no travel deadlines or major restrictions.

Due to the overwhelming response for CFPs in 2020 and 2021, the organizers are
 also considering a more continuous program of smaller events (e.g. meetups, etc.)
 where these and future submissions would make sense to schedule.

# Check Back Here After January 10th 2022!

We are still finalizing the CFP platform and setup, but it will be open on Jan 10th!
