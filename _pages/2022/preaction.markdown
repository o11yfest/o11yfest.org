# What is a '(p)reaction' video?

A "PRE-action" video is a short (<5min) summary of what you think is ***meaningful***
 for others to pay attention to about another video or presentation by someone else.

Since we are receiving pre-recorded talks by speakers all the time, we can provide
 you a chance to "pre"-view them and share your reactions...hence "PRE-action".

# Why do a (p)reaction video?

Not only is this a great way to spread positivity about someone else, it also
 encodes how you process and what you value about the time and effort another
 practitioner has shared with the community.

Our event organizers also would ***love to highlight you*** because we believe that
 you are a material part of our community. When you 'lean forward' to share your
 unique perspective, we care. We're open to sharing this through out social channels
 and even during the LIVE STREAM because it takes all kinds to make a village!

# How can you get involved?

Firstly, email [organizers@o11yfest.org](mailto:organizers@o11yfest.org) and express
 your interest. We'll give you some options about the pre-recordings we've already
 received and get you way to watch it. While watching it:

* take some high-level notes while watching the presentation
* consolidate your points to about 3-4 key takeaways
* record yourself for about 3-5mins talking through your key takeaways
* make sure you comply with our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), avoid strong language etc.
* once done, store it somewhere online and reply back to organizer's email with the link
