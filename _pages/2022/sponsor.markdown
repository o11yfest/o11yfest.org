# Why Sponsor o11yfest?

As an emerging industry of critical players in the distributed systems observability space, your financial support and direct engagement with the OpenTelemetry community exposes both you and them to your brand. For sponsors who already actively contribute to open source projects, an active presence at this event demonstrates your leadership in this industry to key practitioners and investors. For more information, email [{{ site.email }}](/contact)

This year, we are targeting between 500-1000 attendees. Your help to socialize the event will increase this further.

Attendees of this event are typically DevOps practitioners in a wide variety of industries
 and geographic locations. They often value meaningful interactions and active
 involvement by engineers from sponsors rather over sales pitches and junk email spam.

# Our Commitment to Attendee Privacy and Value

We do not sell attendee emails or provide their demographic information. Under no circumstances
 does this event provide these details in exchange for sponsorship money. Premiere sponsorship income
 is devoted to paying for event resources and ensuring the future of this conference.

If you are looking for leads, this is not the event for you. Organization who have
 an ethical understanding that leads are not the only reason to invest in community events
 and that they also have a responsibility to drive meaningful interactions, then we encourage
 you to sponsor this event! Otherwise, there are many other pay-to-play events out there.

# Call for Proposals

All sponsors are required to submit a presentation to [our CFP will be open on Jan 10th](/cfp). Our event is not 'pay to play' or otherwise quid pro quo like some other traditional events, as we do not sell speaking spots...rather, ***we require a [non-sales and non-product] engineering-led presentation*** as contributions from all sponsors who want to participate in and with our community.

The best thing to do for now is to sponsor o11yfest on {{ site.current_event_dates }} and join our
 community for some great conversations and connections!

# Premiere Sponsorship Details

Aside from the above perks, organizers also welcome discussion on the following virtual-friendly options:

- Hands-on booth setup assistance with an organizer
- Tailoring platform capabilities before the event
- Collaboration and synchronization of social media shares
- Team walk-through of logistics one week before the event

# Accessibility / Captioning

Our conference community and organizing group care deeply about providing the most inclusive and accessible event as we possibly can. A key element of that on virtual platforms is to provide LIVE captioning during and curated captions on all video after the event. We contract this work out to a firm which specializes in human live captioning. This usually costs at least ~$3,000 which is a significant chunk of money, but can be offset by a single sponsor who also cares deeply about accessibility. Because captioning affects every presentation, each video will contain a special thanks to this sponsor as a permanent reminder of our shared commitment to this end.

# Contributor Sponsorship Details

In keeping with the spirit and values of the conference, sponsors who donate a minimum total of $2,000 USD to one or more organizer-approved charities and causes also receive a subset of perks. This option encourages for-profit organizations to directly and positively support underrepresented communities.

Suggested Donation Beneficiaries:

{% include 2022-good-cause-list.html %}

If you have alternative non-profit charities or causes you would like to suggest, please ask the organizers to review and approve it for inclusion into this list BEFORE donating. Donations that occur before engaging the event organizers cannot be retroactively counted towards a sponsorship since the event is encouraging net-new donation revenue.
Questions?

All questions can be emailed to [{{ site.email }}](/contact) and depending on the nature of the question, organizers can be scheduled for a brief face-to-face virtual chat upon request.
