# What is o11yfest?

o11yfest is a two-day virtual technology conference focused on empowering DevOps practitioners with solutions that improve observability over systems and processes. It will be held online using a virtual platform on May 17th & 18th 2021, hosted by community leaders and Growgistics LLC in collaboration with leading experts and companies in the continuous delivery and systems reliability ecosystem.

# Why is o11yfest around?

The conference is designed to promote awareness in OpenTelemetry and other relevant projects and techniques related to increasing visibility, transparency, and traceability of mission-critical data across software teams. o11yfest, previously held as [Observe 20/20](https://observe2020.io), is in its second year of operation as a grass-roots event whose aim is to encourage sharing of knowledge and development of the discipline of observability engineering.

# Why change from Observe 20/20?

Last year, [Observe 20/20](https://observe2020.io) was held on April 10th, with hundreds of practitioners and
 community members in attendance. As a point-in-time event, this was great, but
 organizers also feel that it is important to grow this into reoccurring community
 events.

This year, we've rebranded as 'o11yfest' to reflect this intent, and hope to hold
 multiple future events throughout 2021 and beyond under the o11yfest umbrella.

# Who's organizing the event?

Amongst the broader volunteer base that will be helping with this year's event,
 the core organizing group consists of:

- Paul Bruce
- Liz Fong-Jones
- Michael Thomas Clark
- Amelia Mango
- Aaron Aldrich
