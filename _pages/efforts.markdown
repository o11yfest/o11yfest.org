# Putting our Efforts Towards Equity and Inclusion

Our event organizing team is dedicated to increasing equity and inclusion in technology and have already committed to the following:

- [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) that reflects organizer and community values
- Contributing 100% of net ticket proceeds to a subset of community-approved good causes (see below)
- Providing "Contributor" level sponsorships in exchange for a minimum donation of $2000 to a community-approved good cause [(read more in the sponsor prospectus)](/sponsor)

So far, our organizers have decided to scope "good causes" to the following non-profit organizations.:
