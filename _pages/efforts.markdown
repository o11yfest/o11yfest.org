# Putting our Efforts Towards Equity and Inclusion

Our event organizing team is dedicated to increasing equity and inclusion in technology and have already committed to the following:

- [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) that reflects organizer and community values
- Contributing 100% of net ticket proceeds to a subset of community-approved good causes (see below)
- Providing "Contributor" level sponsorships in exchange for a minimum donation of $2000 to a community-approved good cause [(read more in the sponsor prospectus)](/sponsor)

So far, our organizers have decided to scope "good causes" to the following non-profit organizations.:

- [Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org/)
- [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/)
- [YearUp](https://www.yearup.org/)
- [Resilient Coders](http://www.resilientcoders.org/)
- [Feeding America: US Hunger Relief Organization](https://www.feedingamerica.org/)
- [Get Us PPE – Personal Protective Equipment](https://getusppe.org/) to those who need it most
- [KodeConnect](http://www.kodeconnect.org/)

If you feel there are other good causes that should be on this list, please contact the organizers.
