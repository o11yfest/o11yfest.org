# Scope of CFP

We’re looking for you to record either 10-15min or 20-25min technical presentations around observability culture and practices, especially field studies and collaborations. All speakers are encouraged to be available for 10 minutes after their assigned session play time for live questions afterwards, and organizers are happy to help assign the best time for the speaker, given the daily live stream schedule 4pm-8pm GMT / 11am-3pm EST / 8am-12pm PST.

Sample topics include experiences using OpenTelemetry as a form of instrumentation, application of observability tooling to analyze the data, and otherwise how to improve observability in and across organizations practicing continuous delivery and DevOps. In particular, we are looking to highlight the business value of embracing observability across all kinds of end-user organizations. We're also keen to hear about making observability batteries-included by default, so that more people can experience the joys of telemetry in their favorite frameworks and tools.

The typical audience includes SREs, developers, automation engineers, and cloud operations professionals. We encourage first-time speakers to submit, and the co-chairs will offer coaching to any selected speaker who would like assistance or feedback.

# Our CFP is 'Rolling'

Because our conference isn't a monolith or oligarchy, we encourage everyone who has something that complies with the following criteria to submit:

- Your submission should serve others, not yourself
- Your submission should include others, not just yourself
- Your submission should not include product pitches

We will be accepting CFPs from now until April 17th, since being online/virtual means that there are no travel deadlines or major restrictions.

<div class="flexbox">
  <a class="flexbox-button" href="https://www.papercall.io/o11yfest-2022">Submit a CFP!</a>
</div>

If you are a for-profit commercial organization, consider [sponsoring](/sponsor) as well.

# Timings and Notifications

If we accept your submission, you will be notified immediately and will be asked to confirm this acceptance.

Once you confirm, you have until April 17th to provide a link to your recorded video. If you submit your talk on or after April 15th, assume that you should also be submitting your video ASAP.

* Lightning talks (~10-15min) should be NO longer than 15mins, period.
* Full presentations (~20-25min) should be NO longer than 30min, period.

# Recordings

If you want us to help you set up a recordable video conferencing session, you may request this. If not, read carefully below.

Recording tips:

* Your recordings should be as close to 1080p (1920x1080) as possible. Camera in the upper right hand corner preferred, but if you don’t want your camera for any reason, we respect that too.
* Silence you phone, close your email and chat clients, other windows etc, and make sure you are in an undisturbed area as much as possible.
* Absolutely NO BACKGROUND MUSIC. This is not necessary and may even violate content copyrights.
* There is no need to embed o11yfest logos or branding into your presentation visuals.
* Use your best mic and camera, and test them out thoroughly before doing the whole recording
* We do not impose slide formats other than what complies with our Code of Conduct (i.e. insensitive and rude imagery, vulgarity, etc. is right out)
* You should have one slide introducing yourself because we are not going to do lower-third slide-ins etc.
* Please refrain for blatant product pitches, but of course discussing what you personally do in relation to topics like OpenTelemetry etc is fine.

# Cancellation

If after you've accepted, you cannot provide a pre-recorded video before April 17th, no worries. Let us know, one way or the other, and we'll figure something out. We appreciate proactive, slightly-over-communication.

If you've already provided a pre-recording but can't be available for live Q&A, this does not disqualify your presentation and we'll find the right time to schedule it. We can either reschedule the Q&A for an better time for you and attendees, or let them know that your Q&A will be async via our Discord server. In this case, we do hope that you'll still be kind enough to answer questions that come your way.
